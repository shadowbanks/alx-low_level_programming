More Pointers, array and strings


======================================


My Own version of some functions from the standard library


0-strcat - the function _strcat, concatenates two strings


1-strncat - Similar to _strcat but will use (n) bytes from the src


2-strncpy - Copies a string


3-strcmp - Compare two strings


4-rev_array - Reverse an array
